<h2>About Us</h2>
<p><!-- College Fast Pass exists to help students and their parents be better informed and more confident when choosing which colleges to apply to.   -->I'm a husband and father of two amazing children. When my oldest child embarked on her college search, I didn't know how to help her with this important decision. Like many others, I began researching online and was glad to find lots of useful information. This included all sorts of information including admissions info, virtual campus tours, costs, scholarships, housing options, safety information, discussion groups, student reviews, videos, photos, news and much, much more.</p>

<p>However, this searching for the ideal college can quickly become overwhelming for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li> Navigating each school's website to find the contact information for your admissions counselor or learn about their scholarships, honors program, or school clubs is exhausting.</li>
<li>Looking up the same set of schools at website after website is very time consuming.</li>
<li>Being unaware of helpful information that is easily available if you just knew where to look is frustrating.</li>
</ol>
<p>College Fast Pass is your ticket to an organized and efficient approach to your college searh.  We just want to help provide the quickest, most thorough means to finding all the information available online to help you make the best decision for you or your child.</p>
